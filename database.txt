i want to make a database for my project that is online attendance system. where i have three users admin, teacher, student. admin will control all the data of teacher and student. admin can add a new student and new teacher whereas teacher can also add a new student . the functionality of the database will include admin and teacher can send notifications to student id and teacher can manage leave of students, teacher will mark attendance of student and student can apply for leave and she can only view her attendance, student can also raise complaints which will be resolved by teacher. admin can also add branch/ courses and can modify them. teacher can also modify student's attendance. admin and teacher can also view the attendance of students. all the three users will login to their respective id and they can logout from the system, they can also change password of their id.
